# AI Usage Report



---

## 1) Tools Used
- **ChatGPT** (primary): code scaffolding, explanations, wording, and documentation templates.


---

## 2) What I Used AI For
- **Planning & Structure**
  - Proposed the repository layout (`index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `js/script.js`, `assets/images`, `docs/`).
- **Code Generation**
  - Starter **HTML** with sections (About, Projects, Contact).
  - Basic **CSS** for layout, colors, and responsiveness.
  - Simple **JavaScript** features: Dark/Light theme toggle and Back-to-Top button.

- **Troubleshooting & Guidance**
  - Helped diagnose common issues (file paths for images)
 

---

## 3) Benefits
- **Speed**: Faster setup for HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate and documentation.
- **Clarity**: Clear examples for responsive layouts and simple interactivity.
- **Learning Support**: Explanations and alternatives (e.g., different JS features).

---

## 4) Challenges / Limitations
- Some AI outputs were **verbose**; I had to simplify CSS and JS to match assignment scope.
- **Formatting pitfalls** in README (code block fences) required careful editing.
- Needed to ensure **paths/casing** were correct (e.g., `assets/images/clubzone.png`) and clear cache on GitHub Pages.

## 6) Learning Outcomes
- Better understanding of **semantic HTML** and organizing sections.
- Practiced **responsive CSS** (simple layout, mobile-friendly typography/images).
- Implemented small but useful **JS interactions** (class toggling, scroll events, localStorage).
- Improved skills in **documentation** and repository hygiene (commits, structure).

> **Academic Integrity:** I used AI for guidance and drafting, then **edited and verified** all code/content myself. I understand how the solution works and accept responsibility for it.
